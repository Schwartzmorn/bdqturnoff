# Kodi screensaver that turns the projector and the AV on and off

Uses CEC client for the projector and the terrible web API for the AV receiver.

It switches on both automatically when exiting the screen saver, and selects the correct source for the AV receiver.

It turn them off both when starting the screensaver, although it only turns the av receiver off if it's on the correct source.
